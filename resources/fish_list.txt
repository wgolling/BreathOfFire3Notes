ElectroSpectre has a very comprehensive fishing guide https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/196817-breath-of-fire-iii/faqs/40847


Route Overview:
--------------
There are 3 main fishing goals for this route:
1) get the Holy Knife and a Skill Ink early on
  - catch 3 Trout and 3 Rainbow Trout in Yrall
2) accumulate enough points for Giotto
  - catch fish in Yrall and Momo's tower, catch Martian Squid, make up any missing points in Rhapalla
3) get some of Hachio's required items
  - Martian Squid E of Mt. Mynerg, catch with Heavy Caro before Rhapalla
  - Angler SE of Mt. Zublo, catch with Float just before Tidal Caves


Poles:
-----
- buy Wooden Rod during Mygas money-dump, use in Yrall region
- find Bampoo Rod in Tower, use to fish up Black Porgies and get points
- get Deluxe Rod in Northern Checkpoint after Mikba, use for any remaining fish


What to buy at Manillo Shops:
----------------------------
Yrall Manillo: - Silver Knife (2 Trout, 2 Rainbow Trout)
							 - Skill Ink if you want (1 Trout, 1 Rainbow Trout)
							  (use extra Piranha and Puffers on new bait)

Momo's Tower:  - Chain Cap (1 Bass, 3 Blowfish) kind of not worth it
							 - Crepe Cape (1 Black Porgi, 4 Flying Fish) *MAYBE get 2
