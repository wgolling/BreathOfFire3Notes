    - use Ivory Dice if you have extra, but save 2 for Dragon Lord
    - usual strats, used True Kaiser (Infinity + Trance + Radiance)
    - be aware that he has TONS of power and can paralyze
    - maybe not even worth it to use Shield, just use Soul Gems and Manly Clothes

- IF YOU ARE USING REI now would be a great time to grab the locked chests:
    Giant Shield, Dragon Shield, and Dragon Helm

Eden:
----
- take green path to Eden, need Rei
    - Remarks:
        - try to steal Power Foods from FoulWeed
        - Wraiths have magic barriers. If Rei casts lightning Ryu can follow up with Royal Sword (Shadowwalk).
        - Plant42 has VERY high attack
    - go straight to get Protein, then back to entrance
    - pick up Magic Shard then follow path all the way to SW corner then to the door
    - there is a locked door the NEEDS to be opened to proceed
        - HOWEVER you don't have to choose Rei when you fight Teepo
        - I think then Rei should be in the final party instead of Nina
    - on the little room there is a Vodka Shot and Wisdom Fruit in the shelves
    - Silver Tiara behind a tree

    - work your way up to the green portal, pass Peco to the Blue portal
    - Arwan: 2400hp, 5000xp, 0z

        - an potentially outpace you, so make sure you're fast
- Dragon Lord: 12500hp, 15000xp, 12000z
    - protect against confusion and as many elements as possible
    - STEAL AND EQUIP Dragon Blade (this is why Rei is a good idea in this fight) before Ryu transforms
        - Dragon Blade DOUBLES damage output in this fight.
    - Infinity + Trance + Radiance
    - Use Ivory Dice, ideally 2
        - I used 2 and got 20000 each, 3 only gives 21845 each (b/c exp cap)
    - I like to use Hourglass with Ryu for Dragon transformation + two attacks
    - use Weretiger with Rei if things look under control
    - use Aura with Momo if she has extra time
    - this fight can be haaaaard. Spam Soul Gems, use Wisdom Fruit/Seeds when you have to.
